# Flutter Components App

A new Flutter project where I am using several components to learn Flutter and Dart.

## Getting Started

This project contains:

- Homepage using a ListView
- Alerts
- Circle Avatar and profile page
- Custom cards
- Animated container
- Input Fields like texts, emails, passwords, dates...
- Dropdown and DropdownMenuItem
- Sliders
- Checkbox and switches
- ListView Builder + Infinite Scroll
- Infinite Scroll with Futures
- Pull to refresh a ListView

Here is the Flutter [online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
